Alright. I'm Luiz Eduardo, a Software Engineering student at PUCRS College (you can read more about it by [clicking here](http://www.pucrs.br/en/the-university/)). I live in the city of Porto Alegre, the capital of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil. Yes, I'm brazilian! At the time of writing this, I'n 20 years old and I'm in the 4th semester of college. And... here on the right, it's me!


I'm passionate about programming, technology, minimalism and, mainly, UX Design! Since I was little I played with Photoshop creating incredible images (or I thought they were incredible). I'm addicted to learning about technology, my whole childhood was based on staying at the computer learning well.. how to edit videos, edit images, photograph, create music, create websites, learn how to create a game, how to make videos, how to have a page of success on Facebook (everyone already had this dream, right? Isn't it!? üò≥)

Ok.. Nowadays I'm currently work at DaVInt, a scientific initiation laboratory. I'm learning a lot there, and I hope to learn even more!

My current interests in programming are in the creative area. I like to create interfaces, think about UX, UI, create functions that satisfy users' wishes, create a project that includes community participation. Well.. in a nutshell, I don't like to be focused only on the Backend. I'm #teamFront, although I'm training to be Fullstack ü§£.
My current desire for programming is to have full capacity to develop my personal projects from scratch, without any help! Or almost that ... As a child, I created entire projects for personal applications, but all of this in Photoshop. That's where my interest in programming came from! I started to realize that I could create my own projects knowing how to program, I would stop idealizing my ideas only in Design and go to practice, to development!

Nowadays I have a photography Instagram account (follow-me! [@whoareluiz](https://www.instagram.com/whoareluiz/)), I have a great passion for this area and I intend to continue it for a long time! One day I intend to live outside Brazil, my current goal is to live in San Francisco, California to specifically work in Silicon Valley, a dream of every developer, right?! Hahahaha
In addition, I intend to create a YouTube channel about photography, where I would post videos that I think are beautiful (like [this one](https://youtu.be/qJg3ci4Eluw)). I would also like to have a programming channel! My inspiration is [Filipe Deschamps](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU5JicSrEM5A63jkJ2QvGYw), [Gabriel Pato](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC70YG2WHVxlOJRng4v-CIFQ), [Universo Programando](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_kacKyoRRUP0nM3obzFbg), [Guru da Ci√™ncia](https://www.youtube.com/user/LimaoAzeddo) and much more!

Something that is not relevant but I'm proud.. In the first semester of college, when I met new friends, I created a server on Discord to interact and play games together. The server was created just for that, but, with the current situation (covid-19, online classes and other stuff) the server ended up being redesigned to be the server of the software engineering course at my college. Nowadays the server has more than 130 members, including professors, course coordinators, students and even people who work in the area of Software Engineering. <br/>
<br/>
üëâ Currently, the server isn't available for any user to enter. But, in time, maybe I will open up that possibility! When that happens, I'll let you know on this page, so if you're interested, stay tuned! Down here you can see how many members are online.

<img align="center" alt="Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/558087780018683916?label=Online%20members">

I think I already talked a lot about me, if you want to know more, add me on social networks, or just follow me on GitHub! Hahahahah #IFB (Just Kidding)
